# Gerebot

Gerebot is a bot for Discord which was written by me [Kieran](https://github.com/KieranLProctor) using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.
I created this project as something fun to do on the side and also to add to my Discord server to improve the experience.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install gerebot's dependencies and get started.

```bash
npm install
```

After running the above command make a .env file and add the following.

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=[YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN]
OWNER=[YOUR_OWNER_ID]
PREFIX=[YOUR_PREFIX]
EMBED_COLOR=[YOUR_EMBED_COLOR]
DARKSKY_TOKEN=[YOUR_DARKSKY_TOKEN]
MAPBOX_TOKEN=[YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN]
```
